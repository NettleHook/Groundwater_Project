# Agricultural Water Use Predictions with Urban Water Use
Agricultural water use is harder to measure than urban water use due to limitations of the measuring techniques. This paper seeks to explore if measurements of urban water use can be used to predict measurements of agricultural water use with simple linear regression to see if recorded urban water use can be used to assess confidence in future agricultural water use measurements. Unfortunately, it was discovered that measured urban water use cannot accurately predict measured agricultural water use through a simple linear regression, though we still found evidence of a relation between urban water use and agricultural water use. We hope future research may be able to add more variables to create a model that can be used to assess measured agricultural water use.

## Data 

Data used in this project was obtained from [California Open Data Portal](data.ca.gov). The data specifically used are collected through the Groundwater Sustainability Plan and are available [here](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/groundwater-sustainability-plan-annual-report-data/resource/d361ff20-b713-4f57-b3a4-65400933b0a1?inner_span=True) 

## External Resources

The final report and code were written by Catharina Castillo, but the following resources were used for preliminary research:
[Public Policy Institute of California](https://www.ppic.org/)
[Department of Water Resource's Sustainabile Groundwater Management Plan Portal](https://sgma.water.ca.gov/portal/)
